Task:
I will provide you with a JSON file containing code review comments made on pull requests created by developers on my team.
The JSON format looks like this:

[
  { reviewer_name: "Ahmet Atar", comment: "...", date: "2025-11-24T16:02:47.68Z" },
  ...
]
Using this data, I want you to perform the following analysis:

1. Classify All Comments
Automatically classify each comment into one or more of the following categories:
	• Code Quality
	• Performance
	• Security
	• Clean Code / Best Practices
	• Missing Tests
	• Missing Documentation
	• Architecture / Design Issues
	• Formatting / Linting
	• Naming Issues
	• Other
Indicate which category each comment belongs to.

2. Identify Repeated Errors and Problem Patterns
	• Group together similar comments or recurring issues.
	• Detect patterns of repeated mistakes across different PRs.
	• Highlight issues that occur frequently (e.g., “This issue has a high recurrence rate”).

3. Time-Based Trend Analysis
	• Analyze patterns by date (e.g., “most common issues in the past 30 days”).
	• Identify which types of errors are increasing or decreasing over time.

4. Developer-Specific Growth Areas
The JSON does not contain developer names (only reviewer names), so identify improvement areas based solely on the comment contents.
For each developer (or generally for the team if individual names cannot be derived):
	• Most common mistake categories
	• Types of recurring feedback
	• Key areas for improvement
	• Topics reviewers point out frequently
	If developer identity cannot be determined from the data, create team-level improvement insights based on comment patterns.

5. Produce Insights and Recommendations
For each major issue category:
	• Why might this issue be occurring?
	• What skill gaps in the team might be causing it?
	• Suggested training, resources, or practices to reduce recurrence
	• Team-wide actions that could improve overall code quality

6. Generate a Final Summary Report
Present the output in the following structure:
A. Top 5 most frequently recurring issue types
B. Error trends (time-based analysis)
C. Developer-specific or team-level improvement areas
D. Recommended team actions

Notes:
	• Use natural language similarity to cluster similar comments.
	• When needed, rewrite comments into “issue summaries.”
If the JSON file is large, process it in summarized form while preserving accuracy.
